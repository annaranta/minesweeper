#  Minesweeper GUI
This project was a part of Tampere University Programming 2: Structures course.
This program contains minesweeper game with a graphic user interface. 
Some of the project's backend was provided as a template. 
I learned to design and implement a gui with Qt and to use Qt documentation. 
I also practised modularity and learned how to separate the user interface from the action logic of the program.
